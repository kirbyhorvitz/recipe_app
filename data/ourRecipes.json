            "Step 5. Carefully separate the yellow from the white of the egg and place all yellow yolks into a medium sized mixing bowl.",
            "Step 6. To the mixing bowl of yolks, add two tablespoons of mayonaise (regular or low fat works great), a tablespoon of sweet pickle relish, a teaspoon (or just a squirt) of yellow mustard, a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce, and a pinch of salt and pepper.",
